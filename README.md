# 7GUIS implémenté en OCaml / LibGtk3

The 5 first challenges are implemented with in OCaml with the library
LablGtk3 (an object oriented Gtk3 binding). The CalendarLib package
is used to for dates handling.

The 6th challenge (Draw Circle) is not finished.

The 7th challenge (Cells) won't be developped. Gtk doesn't provide a 
real table widget. The listi\_view is closed to this widget, but doesn't
permit the selection of a unique cell.
